- implode()
- explode()

- Superglobals

    - $GLOBALS
    - $_SERVER

- OOP   (Object Oriented Programming)

    - Class 
        - The class name should start with a letter (Capital).
        - Class name can not be a reserved word
        - The class name cannot contain spaces

        - attributes (properties)
            - name
            - age
            - type
        - methods
            - run
            - walk
            - think

    - Object
        -attributes (properties)
            - ahmed
            - 20
            - male
        - methods
            - running 
            - walking
            - can think

    - Access Modifiers
        - public
            - use property or method from any where
        - private
            - can only use the property or method in the class.
        - protected
            - can use the property or method in the class and any class extends or inherits from this class also.

    - Constructor
        - first thing work, boots when creating object from class

    - Destructor
        - last thing work, in the object life cycle

    - New Keyword to create instance from a class

    - Encapsulation
        - reduce software development complexity
        - protect the state of Object
        - the implementation of the class can be changed without worrying about breaking the code that uses the class.

    - Polymorphism
        - single function (form) but many implementations
        - make application simple and extendable.

    - inheritance
        - Relation between classes
        - Re-Usability

    - Abstraction
        - Handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.


    - Interface 
        - only define funciton without implementation
        - cannot define properties.
        - cannot be instantiated
    
    - Abstract Class
        - can define properties
        - should only hs one Abstract function.
        - can has methods with implementation.
